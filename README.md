May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects. In this repo you will find all the files regarding the implementations of the <b>get_next_line</b> functions, both its <b>mandatory</b> and <b>bonus</b> versions.

Mandatory
</h3>

<b>Game actions:</b>
> <i>The player can move in four directions but cannot move into walls. To exit the game, the player needs to collect something. The WASD keys are used to move the main character, and the game has a top-down 2D view. The movements are displayed in the shell, and pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly. </i>

<b>Graphics actions:</b>
> <i>The program should display the image within a window, and window management should be smooth, such as switching to another window or minimizing. Pressing the [ESC] key should close the window and quit the program cleanly. The usage of MiniLibX images is mandatory.</i>

<b>Map actions:</b>
> <i>The map must be rectangular/square in shape, surrounded by walls with a clear path to the exit. It should be able to parse any type of map as long as it follows the aforementioned rules and contains three components - the exit, player start position, and collectibles. Additionally, if there is a misconfiguration in the map, the program should return an error message to indicate the issue.</i>

The project
</h2>

### Map Rules

<b>Map Requisites:</b>
- Only ``P`` *(Character)*, ``1`` *(wall)*, ``0`` *(empty)*, ``C`` *(collectible)*, and ``E`` *(exit)* will be accepted characters in our map (except if you add enemies as bonus)
- The map must be rectangular, i.e. all rows must have the same length
- There must be at least one exit, one player, and one collectible on the map
- The map must be closed, i.e. surrounded by walls

> <i>If any of these checks fail, the game must end with a error message.</i>

üèÜ | The goal is for the player(s) to collect all the collectibles on the map before going to an exit in the least possible number of steps

<b>Map Creation:</b>
- Create a new text file with a .ber extension. This will be your map file.
- Open the text file in a text editor.
- Define the map dimensions using this 5 symbols to represent different elements on the map:
	- 0 for an empty space
	- 1 for a wall
	- C for a collectible
	- E for a map exit,
	- P for the player‚Äôs starting position.

- Create a rectangular or square map, knowing that the map must be surrounded by '1's (walls) and must contain only one 'P' (player's starting point), one 'E' (exit), and multiple 'C's (collectibles). To test all the game features and have a better gaming experience, create a good level design using other game objects such as '0' for empty spaces (where the player can move).
- After creating the map, you can run it by passing the path where the map was created:

### Instructions

When compiling `get_next_line` or its **bonus** version, be sure to include the following flags

```sh
$> gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=xxx <files>.c.
```

Where the `xxx` can be substituted by the number of bytes read at a time into the buffer for the `read` function.
